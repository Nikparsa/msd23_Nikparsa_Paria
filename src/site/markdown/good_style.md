# Good Style Guide

## Writing Good Source Code Comments

1. **Clarity**: Ensure your comments are clear and concise. Avoid ambiguous language.
2. **Relevance**: Only comment on parts of the code that are not self-explanatory.
3. **Consistency**: Follow a consistent style and format for comments throughout the codebase.
4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not state the obvious. Comments should provide additional context, not restate the code.
5. **Update Comments**: Always update comments when you change the related code.

## Writing Good Git Commit Messages

1. **Short Summary**: Start with a short summary (50 characters or less) of the changes.
2. **Detailed Description**: Follow with a detailed description, explaining what and why (not how).
3. **Imperative Mood**: Use imperative mood in the commit message (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
4. **Reference Issues**: If applicable, reference the issue or ticket number related to the commit.
