# Exercise 5: Logging with Log4J

#### Why are Logging Libraries Used?

Logging libraries like Log4J are used to generate and manage log data in software applications. This is particularly important for:

- **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Logs help developers find and understand errors by providing runtime information about the application's state.
- **Monitoring and Analysis:** They allow monitoring application behavior in production to identify performance issues.
- **Compliance and Audit:** Logs are often necessary to comply with regulations and verify adherence to security policies.

#### What Log Levels are available in Log4J and what do they mean?

- **TRACE:** The most detailed level, ideal for tracking application flow and execution.
- **DEBUG:** Used for debugging purposes, showing information useful for analyzing problems.
- **INFO:** General information about the application's operation, useful for monitoring.
- **WARN:** Indicates potentially problematic situations that do not prevent application execution.
- **ERROR:** Indicates errors that affect normal application functionality.
- **FATAL:** The highest level, indicating critical errors that cause the application to stop functioning.

#### What Configuration Options does Log4J Provide?

- **Appenders:** Define where log messages should be written (file, console, database, etc.).
- **Layouts:** Specify how log messages should be formatted (date, timestamp, log level, message, etc.).
- **Loggers:** Configure specific loggers for different classes or packages to control logging behavior.
